        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This recipe makes a wonderful chili sauce for hot dogs. Just place a grilled hot dog in a bun and top with
            chili, grated Cheddar cheese, and diced onions. Serve immediately. If halving this recipe, cover the pot for
            half of the two hour simmer.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes with puree</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
            5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add beef broth to ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
            medium-low and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 30 minutes. </p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Mix tomatoes with puree, chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and cayenne pepper into
            ground beef mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is very thick, about 1 1/2 hours. </p>
